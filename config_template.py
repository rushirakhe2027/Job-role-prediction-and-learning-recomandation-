# Configuration Template for CareerPath AI
# Copy this file to config.py and add your actual API keys

# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key-here"

# Instructions:
# 1. Get your OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 2. Replace "your-openai-api-key-here" with your actual API key
# 3. Save this file as config.py (it's already in .gitignore for security)
# 4. The system will work with built-in roadmaps if no API key is provided

# Alternative: Use environment variables
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY in your system environment variables
# The application will automatically use it if available
